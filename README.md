## Problem Statement

Travel enthusiasts often struggle to find destinations that align with their specific interests, whether for a relaxing getaway, an adventurous trip, or a cultural exploration. With so many places to visit around the world, it can be overwhelming to narrow down the options and find a destination that fits personal preferences.
